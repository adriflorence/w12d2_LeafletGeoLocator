# Map Homework

## Learning objectives:

- practice adding event listeners to items in the DOM
- practice using the Leaflet maps library
- use documentation and online research to add features to your map

## Tasks

- Add a button below the map that says 'Take me to Chicago' (or another city) which moves the centre of the map to be the co-ordinates of that city.

- Add an Info Window to one of the markers on your map (see the Leaflet documentation) with some information about the place it's marking.

## Extension:

Add a button below the map with the text 'Where Am I?'. When the user clicks the button, use geolocation to set the centre of the map to their current location.
